## Hello there! 👋 
My names is **Jose Manuel Cabrera** and I'm from Menorca, Spain. I'm a technology **passionate** and a **curious** person who is always exploring for new things to learn or get more info about that.

Actually i'm starting my journey in Python focused in automation and data analysis for food service bussines.

I've been working as a front-end developer for 3 years but left that to manage a friend restaurants, but you'll know **you never can quit coding once you fall in love** with it.

I'm also a wine world lover and a powerlifting enthusiast
